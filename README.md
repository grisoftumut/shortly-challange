### Objective

Using Swift, Kotlin, Java or Flutter which is your specialty, your challenge is to build out a single page mobile app for URL shortening, integrate with the [shrtcode API](https://app.shrtco.de/docs), and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

### Brief

URL shortening is a technique on the Web in which a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) may be made substantially shorter and still direct to the required page. This is achieved by using a redirect that links to the web page that has a long URL. For example, the URL "https://example.com/assets/category_B/subcategory_C/Foo/" can be shortened to "https://example.com/Foo", and the URL "http://example.com/about/index.html" can be shortened to "https://goo.gl/aO3Ssc ".

Your challenge is to build a native iOS, Android or Flutter app, integrate with the [shrtcode API](https://app.shrtco.de/docs) and get it looking as close to the design as possible. There are plenty of libraries and dependencies available, feel free to use them. Reactive programming is a plus. In case of iOS, it is recommended to buid UI programatically and not use any storyboard or xib(SwiftUI or Jetpack Compose are plus). You can surprise us by adding extra things. (Note: Provided that you specify what you have done extra in the readme file)

The assignment should take around 4-6 hours ideally but you can spend time as much as you need, we don't evaluate the time.

Your users should be able to:

-   View the optimal layout for the mobile app depending on their device's screen size
-   Shorten any valid URL
-   See a list of their shortened links ("Link History"). Link History should be persisted ideally.
-   Copy the shortened link to their clipboard in a single click
-   Delete a shortened link from their Link History
-   Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
    -   The `input` field is empty

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder.

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized. The designs are in JPG static format. Also you will find demo video on `/video` folder.

### Evaluation Criteria

-   Using **Swift**, **Kotlin**, **Java** or **Flutter** best practices.
-   Show us your work through your commit history
-   We're looking for you to produce working code, with enough room to demonstrate how to structure components in a small program
-   Completeness: did you complete the features?
-   Correctness: does the functionality act in sensible, thought-out ways?
-   Maintainability: is it written in a clean, documented and maintainable way?
-   Testing: is the code adequately tested?

### Deliverables

-  Write a README file to demonstrate choices and technical decision you made. Mention target platform version and any setup necessary to build the application.
-  Make sure to include all source code in the repository.


**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
